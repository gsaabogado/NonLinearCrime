It is divided into five sub-sections\n\n::: {.incremental}\n- Data on Injuries\n- Data on hospital covariates\n- Data on Air Pollution\n- Weather data\n:::\n\n2. ***Descriptive Statistics*** contains descriptive statitistics on domestic violence, air pollution, and weather controls. We also divide this section in four sub-sections.\n\n\nAll the raw files needed to run the code are in the [dropbox repository](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/1jyjs84sef7t1nt/AABtbantKPm4OyICNEIklpXLa?dl=0)\n\nIf you want to replicate the study:\n\nDownload all files in the [dropbox repository](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/1jyjs84sef7t1nt/AABtbantKPm4OyICNEIklpXLa?dl=0) while considering the space constraints in your computer.[^1] The files in the repository have a folder-like structure with the following key sections:\n\n[^1]: I recommend downloading the files to an external hard drive to avoid memory issues\n\n1.  **01_RawData** -- Includes the raw data files obtained from the New York State Department of Education, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, The Environmental Protection Agency, and the Census Buro.\n\n2.  **02_GenData** -- Contains the data files I use for the analysis.\n\n3.  **03_scripts** -- Here, I include all the R-scripts I use to transform the raw data into a useful format, perform descriptive statistics, and run my empirical specifications\n\n4.  **AQAs_School_Absences_NYC** -- This folder contains the Quarto files necessary to replicate this website\n\n# Raw data files\n\nAs previously mentioned, the folder 01_RawData folder contains all the raw files I obtained to estimate the effect of air quality health advisories on school absences.\n\n01_schools includes all files related to school absences and school characteristics in New York City. 02_AQI has the data on the air quality index forecast from the NYSDEC and the AQI measures from the EPA. 03_weather contains several data files of weather covariates. 04_shp is a repository of shape (or spatial) files. And 05_dem includes data on neighborhood-level socio-demographic characteristics from the US Census Buro.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"about.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.37","theme":"cosmo","title":"About","description":"This website contains all the data and R-code necessary to replicate the results of the study: Air Pollution and Domestic Violence: Evidence from Mexico City.\n","author":"Ireri Hernandez and Luis Sarmiento"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
