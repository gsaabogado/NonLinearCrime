It is divided into five sub-sections\n\n::: incremental\n-   Crime data\n-   Air pollution data\n-   Inverse distance weighting\n-   The Now-Cast AQI\n:::\n\n2.  ***Descriptive Statistics*** -- contains descriptive statistics on crime, air pollution, and weather controls. I also divide this section in four sub-sections.\n\n3.  **Study Results --** Includes the R code and data necessary to replicate all the figures and tables in the study\n\n# Replication\n\nAll the raw files needed to run the code are in the [dropbox repository](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/9oyfzolf4rz42s6/AABbCWzqnDNQckt60qpniEuMa?dl=0)\n\nIf you want to replicate the study:\n\nDownload all files in the [dropbox repository](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/9oyfzolf4rz42s6/AABbCWzqnDNQckt60qpniEuMa?dl=0) while considering the space constraints in your computer.[^1] The files in the repository have a folder-like structure with the following key sections:\n\n[^1]: I recommend downloading the files to an external hard drive to avoid memory issues\n\n-   **01_RawData** -- Includes the raw data files divided into four main folders\n\n    -   *01_crimes* - It is the repository with all the raw data on criminality for Mexico City and New York. It contains two sub-directories. **01_nyc** has all the crime data of New York City (in CSV and Excel formats) and **03_cdmx** has the analogous data from Mexico divided into two different CSV files (one between 2012 and 2015 and the other between 2016 and 2019).\n\n\n    -   *02_pollution* - Repository with all the air pollution data for New York and Mexico City. It contains two sub-directories. ***01_epa*** contains the air pollution data from the network of monitoring stations maintained by the US Environmental Protection Agency. This folder (**01_epa**) contains two additional folders, **02_daily** contains zipped daily measurement files for each air pollutant and year between 2000 and 2019 for the entire USA and **02_StateData** has a zipped file of hourly air pollution for each US state. Next, ***03_cdmx*** contains the air pollution data for Mexico City spread across three repositories; **01_pol** has a set of csv files with hourly air pollution data. **02_weather** has a similar structure for weather controls. And **03_other** contains a folder with the geographical location of measuring staions\n\n    -   03_shapefiles -- Folder with all the shape (spatial) files I use throughout the study\n\n    -   04_weather - Folder with the weather data for New York City\n\n-   **02_GenData** -- Contains the set of data.frames I use for the estimation of point estimates. Each data comes from the scientific manipulation of the raw files in the 01_RawFiles repository.\n\n    -   01_crime: the folder contains three main files: \n        -  **CrimesCdmx.rds**: Crime data for Mexico City\n        -  **CrimesNYC.rds**: Crime data for New York City\n        -  **crimes.rds**: Crime data for Mexico City and New York\n\n    -   02_pol: The folder contain N main files\n\n        -   **PolCdmx**.**rds**: Air pollution data for Mexico City\n\n        -   **PolWeatherCdmx**.**rds**: Air pollution and weather data for Mexico City\n\n        -   **polNYC**.rds: Hourly pollution data for New York City\n\n        -   **RawWeatherUS**.rds: Hourly weather data for the US\n\n        -   **PolWeatherNYC**.rds: Air pollution and weather data for New York City\n\n        -   **pol**.rds: Air pollution and weather data for Mexico City and New York\n\n        -   **idw**.rds: Inverse distance weighted pollution data for both cities\n\n        -   **PolIdw**: Merge of pol.rds and idw.rds\n\n        -   **PolNowCast*.rds***: Final data frame with hourly air pollution, weather, and AQI values\n\n    -   03_RegData: Contains the files I use in the econometric analysis\n\n-   **03_scripts** -- Here, I include all the R-scripts I use to transform the raw data into a useful format, perform descriptive statistics, and run my empirical specifications. I divide the scripts into tasks, particularly:\n\n    -   01_crimes -- It transforms and cleans the raw crime data into the format necessary to use in the empirical design\n\n    -   02_pol -- It transforms and cleans the air pollution and weather variables I use throughout the analysis\n\n    -   03_RegData -- It merges the crime and air pollution data according to the specifications of the stury\n\n    -   04_reg - Contains all the econometric analysis\n\n    -   05_tab - Generates (one by one) all of the tables in the study\n\n    -   06_plot - Generates (one by one) all of the figures in the study\n\n    -   99_robustness -- Includes all robustness exercises I include in the study\n\n-   **AQAs_School_Absences_NYC** -- This folder contains the Quarto files necessary to replicate this website\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":false,"output-file":"about.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.36","theme":"cosmo","title":"","description":"This website contains all the data and R-code necessary to replicate the results of the study: \\\\ The Nonlinear Relationship Between Pollution and Crime: Evidence from Mexico City and New York forthcomming in Environmental Resarch - Health.\n","author":"Luis Sarmiento","institute":"RFF-CMCC: European Institute on Economics and the Environment","date":"`r format(Sys.time(), '%d %B, %Y')`"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
