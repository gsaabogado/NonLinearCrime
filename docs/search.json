    "section": "Computing the NowCast Air Quality Index",
    "text": "Computing the NowCast Air Quality Index\nTo obtain a single estimate on the effect of pollution on criminality, I transform the hourly concentration of ozone, coarse particle matter, and fine particulate matter into the now Cast Air Quality Index (NC-AQI). The NC-AQI is an hourly version of the standard air quality index used by the EPA since 1976 to communicate the health consequences of exacerbated air pollution. The idea behind the AQI is to transform the concentration of the main criteria pollutants into an easy-to-understand index value that runs between zero and five hundred units. The NC-AQI is different from the standard AQI because the latter is unsuitable when analysing hourly data as it is only valid in a 24 hours period. The idea of the NC-AQI is to better represent the hourly risks of exposure by weighing nearby hours more heavily than the simple running average used with the standard AQIs. For this, before transforming pollutant concentrations into the AQI, the algorithm transforms the hourly values of of ozone and paticle matters according to equation Equation 1.\n\\[\n  NowCast^i_{st}= \\frac{\\sum_{t = 1}^{T} w^{t-1} c^i_t}{\\sum_{t = 1}^{T} w^{t-1}} \\hspace{0.15cm} and  \\hspace{0.15cm} w^* = \\frac{c_{min}}{c_{max}}\n\\tag{1}\\]\nIn it, c\\(^{i}_{st}\\) is the observed concentration of pollutant \\(i\\) at station \\(s\\) in time \\(t\\). In cases when a station does not measure one of the three particles used to estimate the index, I use the inverse distance weighted value I estimate in the previous section. \\(w^*\\) is the weighting factor of each observation defined as the ratio of the minimum and maximum concentration value over the specific rolling average; eight hours for \\(o_3\\) and twelve hours for \\(pm_{10}\\) and \\(pm_{25}\\). In cases when the minimum weighting factor for \\(pm_{10}\\) and \\(pm_{25}\\) is lower than 0.5, the algorithm updates it to 0.5. Once I estimate transformed exposure values, I translate them into the AQI with equation Equation 2.\n\\[\nAQI^i_{st}= \\frac{[NowCast^{i}_{st} - NowCast^{i,min}] - [Aqi^{i, max} - Aqi^{i,min}]}{NowCast^{max} - NowCast^{min}} + Aqi^{min}  \n\\tag{2}\\]\nIn it, NowCast\\(^{i}_{st}\\) is the transformed exposure value of pollutant \\(i\\) at time \\(t\\) in station \\(s\\). NowCast\\(^{i,min}\\) and NowCast\\(^{i,max}\\) are the minimum and maximum break values of pollutant \\(i\\) corresponding to each of the five risk categories in which the EPA divides the AQI. Similarly, AQI\\(_{min}\\) and AQI\\(_{max}\\) are the minimum and maximum AQI threshold values for each of these five categories.1 At each point in time, the AQI in station \\(s\\) at time \\(t\\) is the highest across all measured contaminants in that station, i.e., \\(AQI_{st} = max(AQI^i_{st})\\).\n\n\nShow the Code\n# Load the data\nPolNc = read_rds(paste0(file, \"02_GenData/02_pol/PolNowCast.rds\"))\n\n\nTable 6 contains a sample of the final data set for air pollution.
