It contains two sub-directories. 01_nyc has all the crime data of New York City (in CSV and Excel formats) and 03_cdmx has the analogous data from Mexico divided into two different CSV files (one between 2012 and 2015 and the other between 2016 and 2019).\n02_pollution - Repository with all the air pollution data for New York and Mexico City. It contains two sub-directories. 01_epa contains the air pollution data from the network of monitoring stations maintained by the US Environmental Protection Agency. This folder (01_epa) contains two additional folders, 02_daily contains zipped daily measurement files for each air pollutant and year between 2000 and 2019 for the entire USA and 02_StateData has a zipped file of hourly air pollution for each US state. Next, 03_cdmx contains the air pollution data for Mexico City spread across three repositories; 01_pol has a set of csv files with hourly air pollution data. 02_weather has a similar structure for weather controls. And 03_other contains a folder with the geographical location of measuring staions\n03_shapefiles – Folder with all the shape (spatial) files I use throughout the study\n04_weather - Folder with the weather data for New York City\n\n02_GenData – Contains the set of data.frames I use for the estimation of point estimates.

    "section": "The NowCast Air Quality Index",
    "text": "The NowCast Air Quality Index\nTo obtain a single estimate on the effect of pollution on criminality, I transform the hourly concentration of ozone, coarse particle matter, and fine particulate matter into the now Cast Air Quality Index (NC-AQI). The NC-AQI is an hourly version of the standard air quality index used by the EPA since 1976 to communicate the health consequences of exacerbated air pollution. The idea behind the AQI is to transform the concentration of the main criteria pollutants into an easy-to-understand index value that runs between zero and five hundred units. The NC-AQI is different from the standard AQI because the latter is unsuitable when analysing hourly data as it is only valid in a 24 hours period. The idea of the NC-AQI is to better represent the hourly risks of exposure by weighing nearby hours more heavily than the simple running average used with the standard AQIs. For this, before transforming pollutant concentrations into the AQI, the algorithm transforms the hourly values of of ozone and paticle matters according to equation Equation 1.\n\\[\n  NowCast^i_{st}= \\frac{\\sum_{t = 1}^{T} w^{t-1} c^i_t}{\\sum_{t = 1}^{T} w^{t-1}} \\hspace{0.15cm} and  \\hspace{0.15cm} w^* = \\frac{c_{min}}{c_{max}}\n\\tag{1}\\]\nIn it, c\\(^{i}_{st}\\) is the observed concentration of pollutant \\(i\\) at station \\(s\\) in time \\(t\\). In cases when a station does not measure one of the three particles used to estimate the index, I use the inverse distance weighted value I estimate in the previous section. \\(w^*\\) is the weighting factor of each observation defined as the ratio of the minimum and maximum concentration value over the specific rolling average; eight hours for \\(o_3\\) and twelve hours for \\(pm_{10}\\) and \\(pm_{25}\\). In cases when the minimum weighting factor for \\(pm_{10}\\) and \\(pm_{25}\\) is lower than 0.5, the algorithm updates it to 0.5. Once I estimate transformed exposure values, I translate them into the AQI with equation Equation 2.\n\\[\nAQI^i_{st}= \\frac{[NowCast^{i}_{st} - NowCast^{i,min}] - [Aqi^{i, max} - Aqi^{i,min}]}{NowCast^{max} - NowCast^{min}} + Aqi^{min}  \n\\tag{2}\\]\nIn it, NowCast\\(^{i}_{st}\\) is the transformed exposure value of pollutant \\(i\\) at time \\(t\\) in station \\(s\\). NowCast\\(^{i,min}\\) and NowCast\\(^{i,max}\\) are the minimum and maximum break values of pollutant \\(i\\) corresponding to each of the five risk categories in which the EPA divides the AQI. Similarly, AQI\\(_{min}\\) and AQI\\(_{max}\\) are the minimum and maximum AQI threshold values for each of these five categories.1 At each point in time, the AQI in station \\(s\\) at time \\(t\\) is the highest across all measured contaminants in that station, i.e., \\(AQI_{st} = max(AQI^i_{st})\\)."
